In this project, I used Python and OpenCV to find lane lines in the road images.

The following techniques are used:

  - Canny Edge Detection
  - Region of Interest Selection
  - Hough Transform Line Detection
  
Finally, I applied all the techniques to process video clips to find lane lines in them.
